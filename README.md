## [Data Science Salary Estimator](https://github.com/Mohamed28112003/Ds_Salary_Project) ðŸ’¸
- Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
- Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
- Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
- Optimized Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
## [Mobile-Price-Classification](https://github.com/Mohamed28112003/Mobile-Price-Classification/tree/main) ðŸ“µ
- This project aims to classify the price range of mobile phones using machine learning techniques random forset.
## [Heart-Disease](https://github.com/Mohamed28112003/Heart-Disease/tree/main) ðŸ«€
- this project aims to analyze a heart disease dataset and build machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on several clinical features. We will apply various preprocessing   techniques to handle missing values, encode categorical features, convert data types, remove outliers, and drop unnecessary columns. We will also perform several analysis and visualization techniques to       
  understand the relationship between the different features and the target variable.
